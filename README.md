# Time Series Analysis - River Thames Water Levels 

#### This is a replicated project from the Datacamp platform  

Time series data is everywhere, from watching your stock portfolio to monitoring climate change, and even live-tracking as local cases of a virus become a global pandemic. In this project, I work with a time series that tracks tide levels of the Thames River, generate summary statistics and deep dive into the time series component attributes.
